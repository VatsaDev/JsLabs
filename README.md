# Why should you use this
 - No dependencies

 - prettier formatting
 - automatic Jslint

## Whats coming
 - qrcodes
 - brotli instead of base64
 - url shorteners

Similar in some ways (though unrelated) to the following projects

 - [TinyEditor](https://github.com/umpox/TinyEditor)

## setup

- local
  - download files
  - run index.html
  - develop!

- deploy
  - we have the deploy vercel button, but this is completely static (currently), and hostable anywhere!
